# Fairness Policy

## Our Commitment

We are committed to building fair and equitable hiring systems that promote diversity and inclusion while maintaining high standards for talent acquisition. This policy outlines our approach to ensuring our AI-powered interview prediction system operates fairly across all protected groups.

## Core Principles

### 1. Non-Discrimination
Our system shall not discriminate based on:
- Race or ethnicity
- Gender or gender identity
- Age
- Disability status
- National origin
- Religion
- Sexual orientation
- Veteran status
- Any other legally protected characteristic

### 2. Transparency
- Prediction factors are explainable and auditable
- Model performance is regularly evaluated and published
- Fairness metrics are monitored continuously
- Stakeholders have access to fairness reports

### 3. Human Oversight
- AI predictions are advisory, not determinative
- Human reviewers make final hiring decisions
- Escalation process available for bias concerns
- Regular review by fairness team

### 4. Continuous Improvement
- Regular fairness audits
- Model updates based on feedback
- Incorporation of latest research
- Stakeholder feedback integration

## Fairness Gates

### Statistical Thresholds

All model deployments must pass the following fairness gates:

1. **Adverse Impact Ratio (AIR) ≥ 0.80**
   - Selection rate ratio between protected groups
   - Based on EEOC four-fifths rule
   - Measured for all protected characteristics

2. **True Positive Rate Gap ≤ 0.05**
   - Difference in correctly identified qualified candidates
   - Ensures equal opportunity across groups

3. **False Positive Rate Gap ≤ 0.05**
   - Difference in incorrectly identified candidates
   - Prevents systematic over-prediction for any group

4. **Calibration Parity ≤ 0.05**
   - Ensures predicted probabilities are equally accurate
   - Prevents over/under-confidence for specific groups

### Evaluation Frequency
- Weekly automated evaluation
- Monthly human review
- Quarterly stakeholder reporting
- Annual comprehensive audit

### Statistical Rigor
- Bonferroni correction for multiple testing
- Minimum sample size: 50 per cohort
- Effect size reporting (Cohen's d)
- Confidence intervals provided

## Bias Event Escalation

### Severity Levels
1. **Low (1-2):** Minor language or presentation bias
2. **Medium (3):** Potential demographic bias indicators
3. **High (4-5):** Clear discriminatory patterns

### Escalation Process
1. Event detected/reported
2. Automatic notification to fairness team
3. Investigation within 24 hours (high severity) or 1 week (medium/low)
4. Root cause analysis
5. Corrective action implementation
6. Follow-up monitoring

### Adjudication
- Independent review team
- No involvement in hiring decisions
- Regular training on bias detection
- Access to legal counsel

## Protected Groups

### Current Definitions
Based on EEOC guidelines and extended for comprehensive coverage:

**Gender:**
- Male
- Female
- Non-binary
- Prefer not to say

**Ethnicity:**
- American Indian or Alaska Native
- Asian
- Black or African American
- Hispanic or Latino
- Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
- White
- Two or More Races
- Prefer not to say

**Age Groups:**
- Under 30
- 30-40
- 40-50
- 50-60
- Over 60

### Intersectionality
- Analysis includes intersectional groups where sample size permits
- Special attention to historically underrepresented combinations
- Minimum sample size requirements apply

## Quality of Hire

### Fair Outcome Measurement
Quality of hire metrics must themselves be fair:

1. **Performance Scores:** Calibrated across managers
2. **Retention:** Account for involuntary separations differently
3. **Promotion Rates:** Normalized for role and tenure
4. **Satisfaction Scores:** Validated against bias

### Feedback Loop Prevention
- Regular analysis of prediction-outcome correlation
- Detection of self-fulfilling prophecies
- Intervention strategies for identified feedback loops

## Compliance & Audit

### Legal Compliance
- EEOC guidelines
- GDPR (for EU candidates)
- State-specific regulations (CA CPRA, etc.)
- Industry-specific requirements

### Audit Trail
- All predictions logged with signatures
- Tamper-detection via HMAC
- 7-year retention for audit purposes
- Access controls on sensitive data

### External Audits
- Annual third-party fairness audit
- Bi-annual legal compliance review
- Ad-hoc audits as needed

## Data Privacy & Security

### PII Protection
- Automatic redaction in logs
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access controls and monitoring
- Regular security audits

### Data Minimization
- Only collect necessary features
- Aggregate reporting where possible
- Anonymization for research use

## Training & Education

### Required Training
- All hiring managers: Bias awareness (annual)
